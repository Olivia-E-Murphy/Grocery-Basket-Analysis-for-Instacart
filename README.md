# InstacartGroceryBasketAnalysis
Achievement 4 of CareerFoundry's curriculum, which calls to use Python to solve business questions for Instacart, using a fabricated dataset.

In the "Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis" Project, CareerFoundry calls for students to put themselves in the shoes of an analyst to derive insights in order to make a data-driven marketing strategy to target customers.

Key questions include: what are the busiest days of the week & hours of the day?; If there are particular times of the day do people spend the most money?; Creating simpler price range groupings for items; Are there certain types of products more popular than others?;What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?; Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?; Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?; Is there a connection between age & family status in terms of ordering habits?; What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?; What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
